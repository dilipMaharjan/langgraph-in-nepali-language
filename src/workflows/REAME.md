# Workflows

## Prompt Chaining

- Techique in NLP where multiple prompts are sequenced in a fashion that guides a model through a complex task or reasoning process.
- Breaks task into smaller, manageable steps, with each step of building on the previous one.
- Imporves accuracy, coherence and control when working with LLM.

## Parallelization

- Multiple nodes can operate without dependency
- Can start at the same time or at a particular point
- Can merge in the downstream nodes based on functionality
