## 📚 Topics Covered

Each topic includes detailed notes, code examples, and project walkthroughs.

1. ✅ **Getting Started With LangGraph**  
      LangGraph is an open-source Python framework for building stateful, branchable, and multi-step workflows using LLMs (large language models). It extends the ideas from LangChain with an explicit graph-based control flow, ideal for applications such as:

      Multi-agent communication

      Long-context workflows

      Function-calling and tool use

      Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

      Human-in-the-loop pipelines

      LangGraph allows you to treat your LLM pipelines like state machines, where each step (node) processes or updates a shared state and passes it along a graph.
   
2. 🧩 **LangGraph Components**  
   Dive into the core elements: nodes, edges, state management, and conditional logic.

3. 🐞 **Debugging LangGraph Applications With LangSmith**  
   Learn how to trace and debug workflows using LangSmith for observability.

4. 🔀 **Different Workflows in LangGraph**  
   Explore various control flows like sequential, conditional, looping, and branching.

5. 🧑‍💻 **Human-in-the-Loop in LangGraph**  
   Add human decision points into your graph for review, moderation, or approvals.

6. 📚 **RAG With LangGraph**  
   Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications with structured control over retrieval and synthesis.

7. 🧠 **End-to-End Agentic AI Projects With LangGraph**  
   Combine memory, tools, and planning to create real-world intelligent agents.

8. 💬 **End-to-End Agentic Chatbot With Web Search Functionality**  
   Build a chatbot that integrates tool use, context retrieval, and live web search.

9. 📰 **AI News Summarizer – End-to-End Agentic AI Project**  
   Use LangGraph to fetch, summarize, and analyze news articles in an automated pipeline.

10. ✍️ **End-to-End Blog Generation Agentic AI App**  
   Create a blog post generation tool using RAG, multi-step reasoning, and prompt chaining.
